* TODO P0 Give squash a definition

- couldn't add a `prop` type annotation on squash (see above), so
  assumed squash for now

<dummy>(0,0-0,0): (Error 72) Identifier not found: [Prims.Tot]
Module Prims resolved into Prims, which does not belong to the list of
modules in scope, namely

* TODO P1 Update typing rule for refinements to require `prop`
...  after type-checking squash / prims so that we get better errors
and b2p has some chance of kicking in there too ... this is blocker
for porting more examples without lots of pain

CH: to be discussed, I still think we should do this, but for now
    triggering b2p to go from bool to Type0 too

* TODO P0 Still need to replace the `logic` qualifier with `prop`

* TODO P0 Get rid of all the newly introduced admits in:
** FStar.Squash.fst (4, Giving squash a definition)
** FStar.Classical.fst (many, Giving squash a definition)
** FStar.List.Tot.Properties (2 adjacent ones, Giving squash a definition)
** FStar.TSet.fst (strange! 2)
** FStar.Monotonic.Heap.fst (strange! 1 assume; WIP!)
