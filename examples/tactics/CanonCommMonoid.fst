(* Old discussion discuss with Nik and Guido about spurious SMT obligations:
Nik:
- it's easy to get rid of some of the hasEq goals by just saying `let
  var :eqtype = nat`
- but, we still have some extra SMT goals
- and this is because reification computes a vmap literal vm, which
  computes all the way to a lambda term
  `(fun x -> if x = a then (a, ()) else ... )`
- and we have to prove that this thing is actually a vmap
- i wonder if there's some way for reification to compute this without
  fully normalizing it down to a lambda term, i.e., can we leave it as
  an `update (const_map ...) x a (a, ())` etc.
- if so, then proving it is a vmap will be trivial and will not incur
  additional SMT goals
- this reminds me a little of many prior conversations, including our
  conversation at the pub yesterday, Catalin. i.e., we want to treat
  `update` etc. abstractly in some places, but in other places, we
  want to compute fully with it (edited)
- I think we should be able to do that with our tactics
- e.g., something like `let r = set_norm_flags "don't unfold update,
  const"; let r = reification m [t1;t2] in reset_norm_flags; r in ...`
- for some as yet unavailable `set_norm_flags` tactic
- anyway, it's a detail, but one that I suspect we'll have to solve
  well especially as we build large vmap literals
